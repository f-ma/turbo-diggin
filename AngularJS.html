  AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open-source web application framework
  maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to address
  many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. Its goal is to
  simplify both development and testing of such applications by providing a framework for
  client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used
  in rich internet applications.
