  JSON is a data format, <strong>not</strong> a programming language. <strong>JSON is not a part of JavaScript</strong> even though they
  share syntax. JSON is also not solely used by JavaScript, since it is a data format. There are parsers
  and serializers available in many programming languages.

<h2>SYNTAX</h2>
<p>JSON syntax allows the representation of three type of values:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Simple values</strong> - Strings, numbers, Booleans, and <strong>null</strong> can all be represented
    in JSON using the same syntax as JavaScript. The special value <strong>undefined</strong> is not supported.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Objects</strong> - The first complex data type, objects represent ordered key-value pairs. Each
    value may be a primitive type or a complex type.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Arrays</strong> - The second complex data type, arrays represent an ordered list of values that
    are accessible via a number index. The values may be of any type, including simple values, objects, and
    even other arrays.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Simple Values</h2>
In its simplest form, JSON represents a small number of simple values. For examples, the following is valid JSON:
{% highlight js %}
5
{% endhighlight %}
This is JSON that represents the number <strong>5</strong>. Likewise, the following is also valid JSON representing
a string:
{% highlight js %}
"Hello world!"
{% endhighlight %}
