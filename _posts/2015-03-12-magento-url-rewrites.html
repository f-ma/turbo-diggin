    Magento is a web application implementing a Front Controller pattern, and this means that most HTTP request are routed to the index.php in the root folder.
    In order to display a category, a product, or a non-catalog information page Magento parses the incoming URL to determine which modules and controllers must be engaged to process the request.

<h3>Two significant drawbacks of typical MVC URL pattern</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>It is NOT human friendly</strong>: The IDs used in these URLs tell users
    nothing about the shop products or categories.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>NOT search engine optimized</strong>: These URLs contain only generic terms ("catalog", "product", "category") that have little effect in achieving high search engine positions.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>So,</h2>
<h3>Want to improve this?</h3>
<p>Magento uses a <strong>rewrite engine</strong> to <strong>match</strong> descriptive URLs to its resources. The rewrite engine is a part of Magento core system and is responsible for matching incoming descriptive URLs to controllers, actions, and entity IDs.</p>
<p>It is also tasked with <strong>automated creation</strong> of descriptive URLs for Magento resource.</p>
