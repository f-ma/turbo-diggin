description: >
    Magento is a web application implementing a Front Controller pattern, and this means that most HTTP request are routed to the index.php in the root folder.
    In order to display a category, a product, or a non-catalog information page Magento parses the incoming URL to determine which modules and controllers must be engaged to process the request.
